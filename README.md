How to design your 3D model...  

Change the comma separated values in the text area to modify the model.  
Each row represents a model part:  

Part, Assembly, x, y, z (scale), x, y, z (position), x, y, z (angle)

Currently available parts are listed in the 'Help' dialog.

Assemblies are a combination of parts that can also be used as a part.
Every part must be in an assembly. The top level or default assembly can be called anything e.g. "model".

Use a '#' at the start of the line to hide a part.

3Table is particularly suited to aluminium profile construction design so some profile parts have been included.  
Straight profile parts are set to 1mm depth. Scale the z axis to get the desired length.
