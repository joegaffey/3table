How to design your 3D model...  

Each table row represents a model part:  

Name, Parent, x, y, z (scale), x, y, z (position), x, y, z (angle)

Currently available parts are listed in the 'Help' dialog.

Parents are an assembly of parts that can also be used as a part.  
Every part must have a parent assembly. The top level or default assembly can be called anything e.g. "model".

3Table is particularly suited to aluminium profile construction design so some profile parts have been included.

Extruded parts are set to 100mm depth by default. Scale the z axis to get the desired length.

The model can be edited in the table by clicking the cell or by changing the CSV (Comma Separated Values) text.

If editing the CSV text use a '#' at the start of the line to hide a part.
