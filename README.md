## How to make your 3D model

Each table row represents a model part.

Use the controls below the table to add, remove and copy parts.

Groups are a special type of part that is made up of ther parts

Every part must be in a group. The top level or default group can be called anything e.g. "model".

3Table is well suited to aluminium profile construction so some profile parts have been included.

Extruded parts are set to 100mm depth by default. Scale the z axis to get the desired length.

The model can be edited in the table by clicking the cell or by changing the CSV (Comma Separated Values) text.
